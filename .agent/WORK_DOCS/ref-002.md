### Overall architectural design refactor

High‑level refactor ideas (no code changes, just structure):

- Split CLI from core logic: keep src/backupctl/cli.py thin, move command
wiring into src/backupctl/commands/ and have each command expose a
register(subparsers) function.

- Consolidate shared utilities: a src/backupctl/utils/ layer for
cross‑cutting helpers (schedule formatting, log parsing, cron helpers).

- Centralize I/O paths: a src/backupctl/paths.py (or constants.py split) to
manage all filesystem locations and path derivations.

- Move domain logic into services: e.g. src/backupctl/services/registry.py,
services/logs.py, services/plan.py, to keep CLI handlers clean.

- Add a small src/backupctl/models/ boundary for data shapes only; keep
parsing/validation in models/ and business logic in services/.
