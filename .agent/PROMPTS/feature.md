You are implementing a NEW FEATURE.

Steps:

1. Verify the feature exists in `TODO.md`.
    - If not, reply exactly: "I CANNOT IMPLEMENT IT RN".

2. Create a branch `feat/<feature_name>` if it does not exist.
3. Follow `.agent/CONTRIBUTING.md` for structure and conventions.
4. Implement the feature with minimal, readable code.
5. Update examples, docs, and config/schema if semantics change.
6. Run relevant tests/checks.
7. Verify `.agent/CHECKLISTS/READY_FOR_REVIEW.md`.
8. Summarize what was changed and what is ready for review.
